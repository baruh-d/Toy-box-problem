# Toy-box-problem
This project features JavaScript solutions to the "Toy Box Challenge." The challenge involves managing a toy box with various toy types, including grading students, detecting speeding violations, and calculating net salaries. 

First Challenge: Student Grade Generator
The user is prompted to enter student marks for this challenge, and grades are given according to the following standards:
A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C - 59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E 40

Challenge two: Speed detector
The Speed Detector implementation calculates demerit points for speeding infractions based on the entered speed of an automobile. If more than 12 demerit points are accumulated, the driver's license may be suspended, and it prints the total number of demerit points.

Third Challenge: Calculating Net Salary
Based on inputs like base pay and benefits, this program determines a person's net wage. In addition to calculating several deductions including payee (tax), NHIF, and NSSF deductions, it also offers the gross and net salary.
